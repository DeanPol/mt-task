# mt-task

## 0.1 initial commit setting up tsc and npm

## 0.2 classes, add item, return cart

## 0.3 adding a discount price and quantity counter to the Product

- The idea here is that when we add our item to our cart, we can compare the count of
  this product in our cart with the number required for a discount.

## 0.4 adding Map for key lookups

- Since dealing with many additions of the same key, better to use a map to get count of all products with same key
